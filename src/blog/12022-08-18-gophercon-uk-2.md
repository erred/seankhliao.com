#### _talks_

##### Generics Unconstrained!

Maybe generic constraints are a bit too ugly to show in your API?
Hide them by passing in functions instead.

##### All work and no play makes Gophers something something

You can just write projects for fun.
Also, inspiration from early computing to do "easy" games.

##### gogoprotobuf: How NOT to run an open source project

A sobering retrospective on the both the maintainer's mental health (self worth, priorities),
and project decisions that impacted that.
Well worth it as a warning for future participants of open source communities.

##### What's a front-end dev doing writing Go and why is the FBI here?

Geoip to country center (default for unknown) == bad,
fudge it to point to bodies of water.

##### Causal's 1000x Spreadsheet; Performance beyond profiling

More optimizations,
some alignment things,
probe at your CPU,
optimize for cache line efficiency.

##### Leading in Tech

uhhhh..... influence?

#### _socials_

With an afterparty at a pub,
I tried hard to float around and meet people,
and I did,
though I may have exhausted the pool of high profile people to point at online.
(There was [Morgan Adamiec](https://github.com/Morganamilo) from Arch).

A long 15 hour day later, I collapsed onto bed past midnight.
