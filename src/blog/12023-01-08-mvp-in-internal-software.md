# mvp in internal software

## minimum viable product, but is it really product?

### _product,_ the minimally viable kind

The idea of a [minimum viable product], or MVP,
is an idea drilled into the mind of the modern startup engineer.
At its core, it's executing just enough to be able to test a _product hypothesis_.

A _product_ doesn't exist in a vacuum,
to survive, there must be a market to consume,
and more importantly, a strong market to sustain it,
also known as [product-market fit].
A product (usually) isn't just a technical capability/feature,
after all, we've all seen the graveyard of capable tools
that see no adoption because it's too hard to use.
The user interface/experience is, a lot of the time, what people will remember.

#### _internal_ software

As a site reliability engineer, SRE,
we're most commonly positioned as an enablement team:
producing standards, best practices, guidance,
and self serve tooling to enable product teams tp work autonomously.

I think this requires a bit of a different mindset from the startup mvp product engineer:
unlike a startup fighting for survival in the open market,
our customer base is fixed and captive.
With the appropriate blessings from management,
we can be a monopoly on providing/accessing a particular service/feature.

With a captive market and monopoly power,
the environmental conditions for testing MVPs no longer exist.
No matter how bad your UX/product is,
you can hide it with high adoption rates via management directives.
The MVP becomes a hollow word and arbitrary cutoff for features you put in.

Am I too jaded?
Perhaps.
Or maybe I'm suffering from the continuous lack of product managers whereever I go...
