# job3 12 months

## minimum necessary period

### _full_ year

End of Q2, we look at the goals we set for the quarter,
and realize we've done less than 10%?
Bad goal setting and not fully realizing the dependencies we had
for achieving those goals.

So what did I actually do?
I prodded at our metrics system a lot.
My evaluation of [vector](https://vector.dev/) remains a steadfast DO NOT USE.
For Datadog it is: use it if you don't want to care;
their product direction makes so much more sense once I realized
they were built on a column database (Husky).

There were other things I did,
like on call, fixing other team's bugs,
but nothing jumped out to me as a major accomplishment.
