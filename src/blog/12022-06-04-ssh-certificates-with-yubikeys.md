# ssh certificates with yubikeys

## CA all the things

### _yubikeys_

Yubikey recently had a 50% off sale,
and now I have 4 keys (2 old, 2 new).
This comes with the problem that I now need to copy around a lot more keys
for every machine I setup.

#### _certificates_

Solution? SSH Certificates.

##### generate certificates

1. Choose a key as your CA, I chose `~/.ssh/ssh/5c`,
   generated by `ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -f ~/.ssh/ssh/5c -O resident`
2. Sign the public key part of individual keys (`5r` here) to generate certificates:
   `ssh-keygen -s ~/.ssh/ssh/5c -I 5r_5c ~/.ssh/ssh/5r.pub`
3. Rename the cert to something clearer: `mv 5r-cert.pub 5c.pub.5c.cert`
4. Repeat for each key / CA combo

##### using the certs

I setup everything in `.ssh/config`, allowing me to just do `ssh lilith`

```sshconfig
Host lilith
    Hostname 192.168.100.1
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ssh/5r
    CertificateFile ~/.ssh/ssh/5r.pub.5c.cert
```

On the remote host, `.ssh/authorized_keys` will have lines like below,
where the key is just the CA's public key (found in`.pub` file).

```txt
cert-authority sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com AAAA....=
```

##### hosts

You can also sign host keys, using `-h` instead of `-I`
and with `HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub.5c.cert`
in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

The `.ssh/known_hosts` format for CAs is the same as `authorized_keys`,
and this reduces the churn and lines in there.

#### google compute

If you use Google Cloud Compute Engine,
you can set SSH public keys in the metadata,
and their agent will insert them into `authorized_keys` for you on demand.
Unfortunately, ssh certificates don't work there (invalid format).
