## mount all the things

### _k8s_ volume mounting

A very basic mount:
you get a directory with your secret keys as files.
If the secret is updated, the file contents change
(actually, symlinks to the actual mounts are updated).

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: container1
      volumeMounts:
        - name: m1
          mountPath: /mnt/m1
  volumes:
    - name: m1
      secret:
        secretName: c1
```

#### _items_

`items` allows mounting only select keys, and changing the path they're mounted at,
including into subdirectories.
Each mounted item is a symlink.
It errors out creating the container if the item key doesn't exist.
Update propagation continues to work.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: container1
      volumeMounts:
        - name: m1
          mountPath: /mnt/m1 # directory with remapped keys, updated
  volumes:
    - name: m1
      secret:
        secretName: c1
        items:
          - key: k1
            path: p1
```

#### _subpath_

`subPath` allows mounting a single item at the `mountPath`,
so you get a file instead of a directory.
If the key in the source volume referenced by `subPath` doesn't exist,
it mounts an empty directory.
All uses of `subPath` break secret update propagation.

I think the only reason to use subPath is when you want to mount into an existing directory in the image,
without clobbering the other files in the directory.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: container1
      volumeMounts:
        - name: vol1
          mountPath: /mnt/mount1
          subPath: key-from-source
  volumes:
    - name: vol1
      secret:
        secretName: my-secret
```

#### _projected_

The `projected` versions are like the original,
but they allow combining multiple sources into a single mount.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: container1
      volumeMounts:
        - name: m1
          mountPath: /mnt/m1 # directory with keys, updated
  volumes:
    - name: m1
      projected:
        sources:
          - secret:
              name: c1
```

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: container1
      volumeMounts:
        - name: m1
          mountPath: /mnt/m1 # directory with remapped keys, updated
  volumes:
    - name: m1
      projected:
        sources:
          - secret:
              name: c1
              items:
                - key: k1
                  path: p1
```
