## navigating the tech decisions

### _history_ up to now

September was a lot of staring at logs, 
and the processong pipeline for it.
"It works", is probably the best thing I can say about it.
it's more complex than I would have liked,
but at the same time it's missing a lot of the supporting infrastructure 
around it for keeping it running well.

October and we're back in Proof of Concept land,
this time for rethinking how to do metrics collection.
I've been focusing on the [OpenTelemetry project](https://opentelemetry.io/),
in particular, the [Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) 
and [Target Allocator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/tree/main/cmd/otel-allocator)
for getting metrics endpoints defined by [ServiceMonitors](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/monitoring.coreos.com/ServiceMonitor/v1@v0.58.0)
scraped.
So far loving that I get to reach outside the company for this.

#### _assorted_ other tasks

* Oncall shadowing, occasionally i "steal" work from the support queue as well.
* Firefighting Prometheus, "let's do microservices" and suddenly the metrics system is overloaded.
* Generating stupid ideas for the rest of the infra team.
* Go drinking and learn about things, like actual timelines....
