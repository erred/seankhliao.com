### _gophercon_ uk day 2

More chats, more talks.
But I didn't find an afterparty.

##### State of the Go Nation!

History, (not much) future,
reiterated go1compat,
focus on onboarding.

##### Understanding Language Server Protocol - autocomplete, formatting

a pretty good talk on how LSP the protocol
works and how you'd implement it,
including wrapping other LSP servers.

##### The Hacker's Guide to JWT Security

Tradeoffs of algorithmic flexibility and bearer tokens.

##### Learn how debuggers work by building your own one

It sounded really interesting,
catching all the details proved a bit too much for me,
but I did get a general idea of how debuggers work
(with a lot of cooperation from the kernel).

##### Understanding the Go Compiler

I don't remember much.

##### Incident Management - Talk the Talk, Walk the Walk

Didn't seem to relate too much to Go...
