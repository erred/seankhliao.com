### _doing_ something

For most of March,
I worked from Taiwan which was 8 hours ahead of our main office.
So basically uninterrupted quiet focus time working from coffee shops.
What did I do?
doc fixes, PoCs, solidifying production services (mostly metrics).
Oh and the open source PRs I sent on my flight out,
got accepted on my flight back.

What about April?
I think the result of planning was: fedramp.
In practice, everyone tries to avoid the work,
so more productionizing of protoduction POCs.

Things I managed to write:

- slack bot for compact notifications
- canary app with alerts
- web 1.0 argocd dashboard

While my title remains SRE,
I can't help but feel like half the stuff I do lands
more in the realm of the rest of our infra group (cloud platforms, developer experience).
