# Chaos Communication Congress Day 3

## final day for me

### _37c3_ day 3

Turns out I'm going to miss the last day because of other plans.
So what do I have for my last day here?

#### _talks_

And this wraps up my final day at CCC.

##### Unlocking Hardware Security: Red Team, Blue Team, and Trojan Tales

You might be able to detect silicon level changes with a scanning electron microscope.
If you pay for it and have the patience to carefully do the matching.

##### Numerical Air Quality Modeling Systems

Air pollution modelling

##### Full AACSess: Exposing and exploiting AACSv2 UHD DRM for your viewing pleasure

A successful break of bluray 4k UHD DRM.
You side channel attack Intel SGK to leak a key,
fake remote attestation with intel servers,
and obtain keys from online keyservers.

##### RFC 9420 or how to scale end-to-end encryption with Messaging Layer Security

Better than Signal protocol because it can scale to groups
(instead of groups being a wen of 1-1s).
Everything is a tree.
But also punts some important things to the application layer.

##### Reconstructing game footage from a Game Boy's memory bus

It was impressive,
though some of it may have lost this non user of gameboys....

##### Unlocked: PICing a wireless door access system

Hardware probes into firmware to extract a rolling(?) AES key.

##### What your phone wonâ€™t tell you

Tracking base station changes.
